### Cocepts and ideas 

# Replication: the ultimate standard for strengthening scientific evidence

# Problem: Challenging -- Big studies, no money, really unique study


# Solution: Reproducibility!!! is the minimun standard
# Make the DATA and the CODE available 
# Validation of the data analysis 


#Justification: new technologies, computing power


# What do we need?
        
# * Analytic data are available (Not the raw data)
# * Analitic code are available (the code that is applied to the analytic data)
# * Documentation od code and data
# * Standard means of distribution 


# Challenges ....

# Tool: Literate (Statistical) Programming
# Article is a steam of text and code 
# It can be weaved to produce human-readable documents and tangled to produce
# Machine-Readable documents

# 1. A documentation Language (Human readable)
# 2. A programming language (Machine-Readable)

# Sweave uses latex and r!
# but it have faults

# Knir! better tan Sweave. 
# It doesnt restrict to latex as the documentation language. It can use Markdown

### Scripting your Analysis

## Golden rule of reproducibility: Script everything
# The score of the data analysis
