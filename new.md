# **Important**

Change output to github\_document makes the original .rmd knit to .md so
the code can be rendered when pushed to Git

# **My first R markdown file**

Markdown is a text-to-HTML conversion tool for web writers. Markdown
allows you to write using an easy-to-read, easy-to-write plain text
format, then convert it to structurally valid XHTML (or HTML).

Types

# This is a primary heading

## This is a secondary heading

### This is a tertiary heading

*This text will appear italicized\!*

**This text will appear bold\!**

List

  - first item in list
  - second item in list
  - third item in list

<!-- end list -->

1.  first item in list
2.  second item in list
3.  third item in list

you don’t have to worry about the specific ordering of the numbers in
the ordered list. As long as there are numbers there, Markdown will put
them in the right order.

1.  first item in list
2.  second item in list
3.  Whoops\! Forgot one
4.  third item in list
